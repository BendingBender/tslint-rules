# tslint-rules

A set of custom [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint) rules.


# Usage

Install from npm to your devDependencies:
```
npm install --save-dev custom-tslint-rules
```

Configure tslint to use the custom-tslint-rules folder:

Add the following path to the `rulesDirectory` setting in your `tslint.json` file:

```json
{
   "rulesDirectory": [
     "node_modules/custom-tslint-rules/dist"
   ],
   "rules": {
     ...
   }
}
```

Now configure some of the new rules.


# Available Rules

## `import-barrels`

Enforces usage of barrels (`index.ts`) when importing from a directory that has a barrel file.

#### Rationale:

Allows directories that contain multiple modules to be handled as a single module with a single public interface
and opaque inner structure.
      
This rule works only for ES2015 module syntax `import` statements and checks only **relative** module paths.

#### Usage:
```json
"import-barrels": [
  true,
  {"noExplicitBarrels": false, "fileExtensions": ["ts", "js"]}
]
```

#### Options:

An argument object may be optionally provided, with the following properties:

* `noExplicitBarrels = false`: disallows usage of explicitly named barrels in import statements (`import foo from './foo/index'`)
* `fileExtensions = ['ts', 'js']`: uses the provided file extensions for module and barrel file lookup


## `jasmine-no-lambda-expression-callbacks`

Disallows usage of ES6-style lambda expressions as callbacks to Jasmine BDD functions.  

#### Rationale:


Lambda expressions don't create lexical `this` bindings in order for `this` bindings from outer function scopes to be
visible inside of lambda expressions. This beats Jasmine's own system of managing shared state by passing in a dictionary object
as `this` reference to the user-provided callbacks to take over the memory management from the JavaScript VM to prevent memory
leaks during test runs.

This rule will also check for cases where a call to a function is made with a lambda expression parameter instead of
passing a lambda expression directly as callback to support Angular 2 test style:
```js
beforeEach(async(() => {
  ...
}));

it('something', inject([Service], (service) => {
  ...
}))
```

#### Usage:
```json
"jasmine-no-lambda-expression-callbacks": true
```

#### Options:

Not configurable.
